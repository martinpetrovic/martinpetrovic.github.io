<p class ="Basic-paragraph" id="About">Martin Luther King Junior games is a game development studio based in Zagreb, Croatia. 
We create games in Python using the Pygame module and have created <i>Potapanje brodova</i>. We are also planning to create other
games but for the time being we do not have a project that we are working on however we are always open for ideas and new challenges.
</p>
<p class ="Basic-paragraph" id ="Potapanje Brodova"><i>Potapanje brodova</i> is an offline two player game where you spread your ships across the sea and your enemy does the same. 
In the second phase of the game you are supposed to shoot and sink enemy ships and the winner is
the person who sinks all enemy ships first. We have also created a profile and score system for the game so you can 
track all of your scores. We plan on updating the game to allow online multyplayer, fix some bugs and overall
make the game look better.
</p>
<p class ="Basic-paragraph" id ="System requirements">
The game is not very demanding hardware wise however there is a requirement software wise and that is that you have Windows 10 installed. Also the game will not work if
your screen resolution je less than 1280 by 720 pixels or HD. The game can use up a lot of RAM however if you play normally you will not experience this problem.
</p>
<p class ="Basic-paragraph" id="Team">Our team consists of five members: Luka Uremović who is our senior developer and Foley, Karlo Kuleš who is a developer but also a graphic designer,
Roko Rožić who is our tester, Jana Dizdar who is our business analyst and Martin Petrović who is our developer and Foley. 
</p>
<p class ="Basic-paragraph" id ="Costumer support">If you have any issues there is always our costumer support: <i>martin.petrovic5@skole.hr</i> . If you find any bugs or have any complaints feel free to 
send us an e-mail.
